## Instructions

Open 'index.html' to start using this neighborhood searching app. Allow your browser to run the geolocation function so that the app can find where you are. Type keywords and click 'Go!' to search places you want to go or to know. Type keywords and the app will automatically filter the search results. Clicking any place name of the places list on the left will focus the place's marker on the map and open an info window showing detail information about this place. Have fun knowing more about your neighborhood.

## Implementation

* index.html - rendering html elements and linking to libraries like jQquery and KnockOut
* css/app.css - stylishing the page with the help of BootStrap
* js/app.js - the MVVM of the app (detail explanations inside the file)

## Contributing

This repository is just a project practice.

***

This is the delivery to Udacity's *Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree* Project **Neighborhood Map**. The whole app is built upon KnockOut following its MVVM practice with the help of Google Map API and Media Wiki API.
